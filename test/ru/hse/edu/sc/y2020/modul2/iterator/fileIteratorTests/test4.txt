Gold Roger, the King of the Pirates, attained this and everything else the world had to offer.
And his dying words drove countless souls to the seas:

These words lured men to the Grand Line in pursuit of dreams greater than they've ever dared to imagine!
This is the time known as 'The Great Pirate Era'!
